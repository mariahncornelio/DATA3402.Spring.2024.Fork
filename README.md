# Overview
In this Kaggle Project, I was tasked to predict what a customer would buy and what product they already have from Santander Spain's customer database by the end of May 28, 2016. The main goal of this project was to predict what new products customers will purchase. The database and description of this project can be found here: (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santander-product-recommendation/data?select=train_ver2.csv.zip). 

# Summary of Work
### Dataset Description
The data was 240.06 MB and contained 3 .zip files named "train.csv" for the training set, "test.csv" for the test set, and "sample_submission.csv" which gave a sample submission file in the correct format. For the data fields, the columns were all in Spanish meaning I had to translate it to it's respective English description. The contents of the data spans from January 28, 2015 and lasts up until May 28, 2016 which is about 1.5 years of the customers behavior data from Santander Bank in Spain.
